      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
       Recently I decided to learn programming as an alternative to my current career path.
      </p>

      <p>
       This idea was brewing inside of me for quite a while, but recently I was lucky enough to experience serendipity ‚Äî where I learned that I learn best when I actually practice something instead of drumming theory into my head.
      </p>

      <p>
        (I know, <strong>SHOCKER!</strong>). So here I am.
      </p>

       <p>
        It wasn't my only inspiration though, as a lot of the inspiration (I would say the most part even) was my boyfriend. He's a great full-stack developer and I was always in awe watching him do things and succeed at them. He's one of those guys that don't make excuses and just do something that they're passionate about. I might not have the same passion for programming (I know too little to be sure yet), but even if I have one yota of the dedication that my boyfriend has ‚Äî  I'll be quite happy with it.
